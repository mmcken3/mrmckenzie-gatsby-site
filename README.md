# Mitchell McKenzie Gatsby Site

This is a rebuild of my personal website using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I found this JS Framework to be very easy to use and it has a very supportive community. I found a really good looking starter using gatsby to learn with and make some adjustments to it for use as my personal website. I have plans to keep working with Gatsby building more sites from the start instead of using starters because the integrations of GraphQL and Markdown into the framework are intersting to me.

This website is hosted using AmazonS3 and CloudFront. And the contact form is hitting an API hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) that was built by me and you can check the code for it out [here](https://github.com/mmcken3/email-api).

This site was built using the Gatsby Dimension Starter kit, you can find that orignal starter kit [here](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension).
